# KEYLOGGING-PREVENTION-USING-RANDOMIZING-KEYBOARD
We developed a sophisticated randomized keyboard JavaScript module that can be seamlessly integrated into login pages, utilizing the ROT18 algorithm. This algorithm employs a technique of rotating the alphabet and numbers while also rotating the key, thus ensuring that the user must type the password using the keyboard layout that is displayed on screen. Through this innovative solution, we aim to mitigate the risk of keylogger attacks and safeguard sensitive data, providing a much-needed solution in the ongoing battle against cybercrime. Our project represents a significant advancement in the field of online security and privacy, and we are confident that it will prove to be a valuable tool in the fight against cybercrime.
